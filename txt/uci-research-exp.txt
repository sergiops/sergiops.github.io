Created a productivity add-on for Google Sheets to enabled instructors
to grade homework more efficiently in team based learning environments. Afterwards,
the add-on was deployed and used in a university physics course with 400 students.
During the development process, I was also responsible for testing the system and
ensuring that all requirements were met.
