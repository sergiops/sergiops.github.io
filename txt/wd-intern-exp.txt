In the Summer of 2018, I successfully completed my first internship
at Western Digital. During my time there, I created a web portal to manage
over-the-air software updates for over 10,000 devices. My role mainly focused
on creating the front-end using React. However, I was also able to add functionality
to the back-end using Python. Due to the amount of devices being managed, the
biggest challenge was ensuring that the app could operate at large scales. In order
to address that challenge, caches were used and throttling algorithms were implemented.
Once the app was deployed, the primary users of the app included my manager and the quality
assurance team. Lastly, I published the documentation to an internal wiki,
and tracked development progress using Git and JIRA.
